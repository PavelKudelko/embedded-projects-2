# Embedded Projects 2 Course

## Overview
This repository is a continuation of the [Embedded Projects 1 Course](https://github.com/PavelKudelko/embedded_projects1_course). While the first course focused on motor control and basic IoT integration, this project extends the functionality with LIDAR sensing and enhanced ESP8266 communication.

## New Features

### LIDAR Integration
* **Distance Sensing**: Real-time distance measurement using LIDAR (Garmin lidat lite v2)
* **Web Visualization**: Browser-based visualization of LIDAR data
* **Dynamic Updates**: Continuous data streaming from sensor to web interface

### Enhanced ESP8266 Communication
* **Two-Way Communication**: Bidirectional data flow (ESP8266 and Arduino Mega)
* **Optimized Transmission Rates**
* **Real-Time Feedback**: Enhanced status monitoring and control

## Topics Covered
* **LIDAR Technology**: Integration and data processing
* **Advanced IoT Communication**: Enhanced ESP8266 protocols
* **Web Data Visualization**: Real-time sensor data display
* **Serial Communication Optimization**: Enhanced data transfer rates
* **System Integration**: Combining multiple sensors and modules

## Previous Work
This project builds upon the foundation established in the Embedded Projects 1 course. For the initial implementation featuring motor control, joystick navigation, compass-based adjustment, and basic ESP8266 integration, please see:
